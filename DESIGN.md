## Fun

This game will be a side-scrolling shooter in a 2.5D layout. It is heavily inspired by the [1990 Aliens Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_(1990_video_game)) by Konami. Being an arcade-style game, it will be built around high-score seeking. A time counter will be included for people who prefer speed-running vs completionism. The game will be a single continuous stage (avoids loading logic). If time permits, I will attempt to include multiplayer using [Matchbox](https://github.com/johanhelsing/matchbox), and ideally allow an arbitrary number of players.

## Presentation

Due to my limited artistic ability, I will employ a paper-craft aesthetic using actual drawings from Frank (my younger brother). A childish "paper cutouts on a notebook" style should be simple to implement and produce given the time constraints. Sound design may or may not use a similar "hand made" style (human voice sound effects?).

## Theme Interpretation

The theme of _"That's a lot of entities!"_ will be met by including swarming enemy types that must be killed with various area-of-effect weapons. This will feel like fighting a fluid more than an individual enemy due to the shear quantity. Combining this with a sliding scale of more individual and boss enemies should force the player to rotate through weapon types to best combat the threat.
